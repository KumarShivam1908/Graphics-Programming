# History & Getting Started with OpenGL

## A Quick Look at OpenGLâ€™s History
Alright, so before we jump into the details of OpenGL, letâ€™s talk a bit about where it comes from. OpenGL (short for Open Graphics Library) has been around since the early '90s. It was originally created by Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) as an open standard for 3D graphics (yeah, it's been around for quite a while!). Back then, if you wanted to do any serious graphics programming, you pretty much had to use proprietary APIs tied to specific hardware. OpenGL changed that by providing a unified way to interact with graphics hardware, no matter who made it. So, it gave us the flexibility to do what we wanted.

Over the years, OpenGL has gone through a bunch of updates. It started off as a fixed-function pipeline (where you had to manually set up everything with predefined functions), but modern OpenGL is all about shaders and giving you way more control over how things get rendered. The latest versions are a lot closer to how modern GPUs actually work, which is great for performance and flexibility.

So, it went something like thisâ€”
- In 1991, SGI started developing OpenGL in its basic form, nothing too special.
- Soon, new versions started rolling outâ€”supporting textures, fixed-function pipelines, and the best part â†’ Shaders!
- As time went on, graphics programmers wanted more control over the graphics pipeline, so versions 3.3 and 4.0 started removing some of the old functionality and introduced a fully programmable pipeline.
- Today, we use OpenGL 4.6 (at the time of writing).

## Getting Started with OpenGL
So yeah, Iâ€™ll keep adding theory topics one by one, explaining each in a way that's easy for beginnersâ€”just how I learned it. If I can make your graphics programming journey easier, thatâ€™s a big win for me. Documenting our journey and breaking down these theory topics also helps us (Arnav and Shivam) get better at them too.

Well yeah, thereâ€™s a separate coding section, and this is the theory section, so make use of both. Iâ€™ll try to reference the theory sections wherever theyâ€™re needed in the coding section. And yeahâ€”have fun learning!

## Where to Go Next
This is just the beginning, but donâ€™t worryâ€”Iâ€™ll be covering all these topics in separate sections. Take it one step at a time, experiment, and most importantly, have fun with it! OpenGL can feel overwhelming at firstâ€”trust me, weâ€™re also just getting started with itâ€”but once things start clicking, itâ€™s an amazing tool for building cool graphics applications. Letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€
