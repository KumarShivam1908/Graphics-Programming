# Computer Graphics üñ•Ô∏è

Welcome to our repository!  

We are Computer Science undergraduates at VIT Vellore who are deeply interested in **Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, AI/ML, and High-Performance Systems**.  

## About This Repository  
This repository is a collection of our **projects, learning journeys, guides, and resources** in the field of computer graphics. We explore topics like:  
- **OpenGL & Vulkan**  
- **Ray Tracing & Real-time Rendering**  
- **Shader Programming (GLSL, HLSL, etc.)**  
- **Mesh-Slicing & Layering**  

Our goal is to develop a strong foundation in graphics programming while working on exciting projects that push the boundaries of real-time visualization.
