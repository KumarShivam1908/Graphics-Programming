## About This Repository (In Progress)
This repository is a collection of our **projects, learning journeys, guides, and resources** in the field of computer graphics. We explore topics such as:

- **OpenGL Tutorial**  
- **Ray Tracing & Real-time Rendering**  
- **Shader Programming (GLSL, HLSL, etc.)**  
- **Mesh-Slicing & Layering**  

Our goal is to develop a strong foundation in graphics programming while working on exciting projects that push the boundaries of real-time visualization. We also want to help others learn through our journey, so we've structured everything in an easy-to-follow way.
